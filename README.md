We can conclude that there could be a possibility of influence of the types of movies that are released in Tamil Nadu from real data like Alcohol consumption and crimes committed.

### NOTE:
There are several factors to be considered such as new state laws, economy, tourism, pandemic, unrated data which have been ignored for the project. I have only scraped data for the alcohol revenue in Tamil Nadu and IMDB rating for Alcohol, Smoking and Substance abuse. 

This project has been created only for personal understanding of the following <br> <ul><li>Web Scraping via BeautifulSoup</li><li>Pandas</li><li>Matplotlib</li></ul>
