# Question:

2. Collect data about Alcohol from Wikipedia (2015-2021)
3. Clean datasets
4. Join datasets using primary key as year
5. Form visualizations to understand effect

# Tools used:
1. Python(Jupyter Notebook)
2. Libraries:
<ul>
  <li>Pandas</li>
  <li>BeautifulSoup</li>
  <li>Matplotlib</li>
  <li>Re</li>
 </ul>

# Result :

<br><span style="color:green"><b>RESULT:</b><br>We can conclude that in the past ten year when the top Tamil movies have a surge in displaying alcohol and substances content, the purchasing of alcohol (in turn the consumption) is reduce.<br><br>We notice this in 2016 when there is an all time low in revenue of alcohol and an all time high in displaying alcohol in Tamil movies.
