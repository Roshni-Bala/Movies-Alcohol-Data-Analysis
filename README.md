# Movies and Alcohol in Tamil Nadu: Data-Analysis Project

## Question:
Does showing consumption of alcohol in Tamil Movies have an affect on the population of Tamil Nadu?
## Processes:
1. Data Collection via Webscraping
2. Data cleaning
3. Data analyzing 
4. Data visualizations
## Process Expanded:
1. Collect data about movies from IMDB (2015-2021)
2. Collect data about Alcohol from Wikipedia (2015-2021)
3. Clean datasets
4. Join datasets using primary key as year
5. Form visualizations to understand effect

## Tools used:
1. Python(Jupyter Notebook)
2. Libraries: 
    a. Pandas
    b. BeautifulSoup
    c. Matplotlib
    d. Re

## Result :

<br>
Alcohol consumption and Displaying alcohol in movies are inversely proportional. 
We can conclude that in the past few years when the top Tamil movies have a surge in displaying alcohol and substances content, the purchasing of alcohol (in turn the consumption) is reduced.
It is evident from the visualizations that in 2016, when there is an all time low in revenue of alcohol, there was an all time high in displaying alcohol in Tamil movies. Similarly, we note the opposite effect in 2020.

### NOTE:
There are several factors to be considered such as laws, economy, tourism which have been ignored for the project. I have only scraped data for the alcohol revenue in Tamil Nadu and IMDB rating for Alcohol, Smoking and Substance abuse.
